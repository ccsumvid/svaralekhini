Selected Pitchy for pitch detection due to speed and accuracy. Created research document with technical recommendations.","Created main HTML structure with UI controls for base pitch selection, notation style toggle, language selection, recording controls, and visualization areas.","Created comprehensive JavaScript application with Web Audio API recording, Pitchy.js pitch detection, 12 swarasthana mapping, glide detection, seminote filtering, drone generator, and export functionality. Implemented real-time visualization and analysis features.","Completed multi-language support with IAST transliteration, syllable-to-note synchronization engine, and PWA manifest. Enhanced the app with language-specific svara names and automatic syllable processing for Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Sanskrit, and English."],"modified_files":["/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svarascribe/research.md","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svarascribe/index.html","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svarascribe/app.js","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svarascribe/manifest.json","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svarascribe/languages.js","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svarascribe/index.html","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svarascribe/app.js"],"id":"1759942280843"}
