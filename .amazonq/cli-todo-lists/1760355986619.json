Found issue with Ga2 detection - it's being detected as Ri2 (440Hz should map to Ga2, not Ri2). Need to fix frequency mapping.","Real audio analysis shows detected frequencies are much lower than expected G4 (392Hz). The detected frequencies are around 200-370Hz range, suggesting the audio might be in a lower octave or different base pitch. Need to recalibrate base pitch detection.","Successfully detected the Mayamalavagowla aarohana with 87.5% accuracy (7/8 notes correct). The sequence Sa → Ri1 → Ga2 → Ma1 → Pa → Da1 → Ni2 was detected correctly. Only missing the final upper Sa. Auto-detected base pitch as ~198Hz (G3) instead of G4. Fixed Ga2 mapping to 3 semitones. Algorithm working correctly."],"modified_files":["test-mp3.js"],"id":"1760355986619"}
