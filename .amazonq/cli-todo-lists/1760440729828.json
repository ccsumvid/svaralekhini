The lyric editor now has a textarea for input, pause/resume controls, and notation lines that will display notes for each line of lyrics.","Implemented core lyric editor functionality: Added pause/resume recording, line-by-line recording with Enter key navigation, note alignment controls, and updated live notation display to show notes per line. Created comprehensive tests for the new functionality. The system now supports multi-line lyrics with individual notation lines and proper state management.","Completed the lyric editor transformation: Ensured existing functionality remains intact by updating the displayLiveNotation method to work with the new lyric editor system while maintaining backward compatibility. Removed old liveNotation divs and cleaned up leftover code. All tests are passing (38 tests total) and the system now supports both the new lyric editor functionality and maintains compatibility with existing features."],"modified_files":["/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svaralekhini/index.html","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svaralekhini/styles.css","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svaralekhini/app.js","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svaralekhini/app.js","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svaralekhini/lyric-editor.test.js","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svaralekhini/index.html","/Volumes/ssd1/projects/svaralekhini/app.js"],"id":"1760440729828"}
